Not for the high life entertaining, 
Just being charmed by friendly care,  
I’m giving you this bail intending 
To reward you more just and fair 
By worthy of your lofty feeling 
Suffused with consecrated dream 
The Poetry serene and living, 
The thoughts and ease in high esteem.
But let it be, your care revealing
Accept the florid chapters’ row,
Semi-amusing, semi-wistful,
Ideal, folkish, sometimes blissful,
What my light-headed pen did draw,
The fruits of vigils, inspirations,
Immature and now faded years,
Of the cold mind’s observations
And of my heart so doleful breaths.
